OMLet provides a much better indentation for Caml/OCaml files than the official one. It mostly behaves as tuareg-mode for emacs does. Omlet supports most of the language features, including objects. I believe that the result is already very convincing, check at (http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/david.baelde/productions/omlet.php). You are no more forced to switch to emacs for editing OCaml! And omlet also provides nice folding...

OMLet is nearly stable, and will then be included as official OCaml indentation file in VIm. For now, it is available in the Debian package ocaml-tools.

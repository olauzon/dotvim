* OMLet now overrides OCaml correctly. That's ugly but needed, because OCaml is installed with VIm.
* Added OCaml modeline support
* Prevented a few abusive autoindentation, when atoms begin like keywords ("incr"...)
* Multiple comments are now aligned on the next real block
* New option omlet_middle_comment, still has pb with autoindent
* Corrected the parsing return value, indentation of "and" is OK now
* Indentation code for ";" handles "bla ; bla ;\nbla" better
* Added "mod"

* Enhanced a lot the expression backward parsing, including many infix operators, which are now well considered regarding their binding power
* s:indent() was enhanced a lot
